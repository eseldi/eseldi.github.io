                I am an interdisciplinary designer, researcher, and artist whose work focuses on questions around the environmental impact of network infrastructure and data production, digital and sensorial perception of urban space and public imagination.

                I am currently finishing the SMArchS Design and Computation degree at MIT.

                In the past, I have been a lecturer at Northeastern University in Boston, MA and designer at Landing Studio in Somerville, MA.
                I received a M.Arch degree from Princeton University School of Architecture and a B.Arch from the Institute for Art and Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.

                This website uses a simplistic design, no animations or interactive components to reduce the energy footprint of my digital self.
